Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are github repo -> github repo clones. Clones copy a repo from a location to your local computer. Branches are unique paths containing different sets of commits that break off a common start part and can later be merged.
You would use branches to test new additions, features, versions, etc. of a project. You use clones to copy a repo to your computer. You use forking to copy a github repo you want to edit to your own github repo that you control and that doesn't affect or change the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote locally is that if you're offline you can see the last time you synced up your local changes to the remote.
This tells you what's been added since then.
