When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Anytime you want to have your work backed up to the cloud, publicly available, or privately available to others within your organization.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If git was automatically downloading changes all the time to your local repository, you might download changes you don't want that another person pushed to github.
Additionally, somebody could put something malicious in there and have it auto-download to your computer if it's a public repository
